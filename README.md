# [CurtainsUp](http://alexduloz.github.com/CurtainsUp/)

## An aggregator of coolness/amazing tools for your web projects

[Project homepage](http://alexduloz.github.com/CurtainsUp/)

CurtainsUp is a boilerplate which has the philosophy of providing developers with *a real lot* of cool libraries. All those tools are disabled by default (commented out). Start coding, and unleash a tool every time you need it by uncommenting it. 

CurtainsUp is also available as a Wordpress template (based on the <a href="http://alexduloz.github.com/frontin/" title="Frontin">Frontin</a> project) named "CurtainsUp For Wordpress".

## Download

The files you are going to need are located either in cup (static site) or cupful (Wordpress template).
